Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program which I started working on 14 December, 2017.

# Program Outline:

### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision
#### 1. Computer Vision
- Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
- Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines
- Project 5: Vehicle Detection

#### 2. Deep Learning
- Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier
- Project 3: Behavioural Cloning
  - Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network.
  - Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.
