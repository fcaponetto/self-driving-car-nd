### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* README.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a implementation of Nvdia Autonomous Model using multiple convolution neural network layer.

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model
I decided not to modify the model NvidaModel by applying regularization techniques like Dropout MaxPooling. Instead, I decided to keep the training epochs low: only three epochs. 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (80% train - 20% validation). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 86).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road using Udacity data files.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar with few layer and I thought this model might be appropriate because the number of feature to analyze from image could be not too much. Tring this approch, on the first track, the car went straight to the lake. I needed a more accurate model and some pre-processing data.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, i decided to use [Nvida Model for Autonomous Car] (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/). Augmented the data by adding the same image flipped with a negative angle and using the central camera plus the sides cames (right and left) helped the car to stay (more or less) in the center of the lane.

#### 2. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image1]

I then recorded used the sides camera (with correction stearing angle of 0.2Â°). In that way, you should simulate your vehicle being in different positions:

![alt text][image2]
![alt text][image3]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would helps the network to anderderstand more general case of the track (reverse mode).

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 3 as evidenced by tests.
